The following information reflects what is new in the edX Platform as of September 4,
2014. See previous pages in this document for a history of changes.

****************************************
edX Release Announcements Mailing List
****************************************

These edX Course Staff Release Notes are always available and are updated with
each release of the edX Platform on `edx.org`_ and `edX Edge`_.

You can also sign up for the `edX Release Announcements mailing list`_ to get
an email message when we update the edX Course Staff Release Notes.

***************************************
edX Website
***************************************

* Users who signed up for a verified course sometimes saw an incorrect 
  price. This bug has been fixed. (ECOM-113)

* A problem with auto-registration sometimes prevented verified courses from 
  appearing on a user's dashboard. This bug has been fixed. (ECOM-199) 

*******************************
edX Learning Management System
*******************************

* This release includes changes that improve student and staff experiences with
  course discussions. These new features take effect immediately in all courses.

  * When a discussion participant adds a post, the participant must now identify the post as
    either asking a question or starting a discussion.

  * Controls for actions that discussion participants can take on posts, responses, 
    and comments have moved to the top right of each contribution. 

  * Informational labels such as "Staff" and "Following" have been redesigned and relocated.

  For more details, see our `End of August Product Announcement`_.

* Students can now submit their usernames and email addresses to a third party
  by using an LTI interface. (BLD-1250)

* The bulk email feature is now available for all Studio-backed courses on the `edx.org`_ site. 
  With this feature, you can send email messages to course participants directly from 
  the Instructor Dashboard before, during, and after the course run. For more information, 
  see `Bulk Email`_ and `Example Messages to Students`_.


**************************
Coming Soon
**************************

We're pleased to announce the following change, which will be released in the next few
weeks:

* Course teams will soon be able to access data about their courses on a
  dedicated dashboard for course-specific data. By providing insights into who
  your students are, and what they do while interacting with your course, the
  data available on this dashboard can validate choices youâ€™ve made, reveal
  unexpected patterns, and inform plans for changes to the course.
