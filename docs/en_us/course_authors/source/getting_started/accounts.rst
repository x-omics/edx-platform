Getting Started with edX
#############################

The following sections provide an introduction to edX and instructions for getting started on edX websites:

* :ref:`edX.org and edX Edge`
* :ref:`Register Your Account`
* :ref:`edX101_section`
* :ref:`Reset Your Password`

This information is intended for course staff. You may want to include the details about the registration process and password policies in your communications with your prospective students. 

Also see :ref:`enroll_student` for information about enrolling students in a course, and for an example of the email students receive.

.. _edX.org and edX Edge:

*************************
edX.org and edX Edge
*************************

When you want to explore edX courses, you can register on edX.org_, edX Edge_, or both. These sites are visually and functionally the same, but the content and purpose are different.

* edX.org_ hosts massive open online courses (MOOCs) from edX institutional partners. To publish courses on edX.org, you must have an agreement with edX and specific approval from your university. Courses on edX.org are publicly listed in the edX course catalog and are open to students from around the world.

* EdX Edge_ is edX's more private site. Courses on Edge are not published on edX.org. Any member of a partner course team can create and publish courses, including test courses, on Edge without receiving approval from edX or an affiliated university. However, Edge does not have a course catalog, and courses cannot be found through search engines such as Google. Only students whom you explicitly invite or who have the URL for your course can participate in your course on Edge.

* EdX Edge_ also hosts small private online courses (SPOCs).

.. note:: All course data and accounts on Edge_ and edX.org_ are separate. If you want to use both edX.org and Edge, you must go through the registration process on both sites.

.. _edX101_section:

******************************
edX101 and the edX Demo Course
******************************

EdX has provided edX101_ and the `edX Demo course <https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edx-edxdemo101-edx-demo-1038>`_ to help familiarize you with taking and creating edX courses.

* edX101_, available on Edge_, is an example of a course built with Studio. It is a self-paced walk through of planning, building, and running your own online course.

* The `edX Demo course <https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edx-edxdemo101-edx-demo-1038>`_, available on edX.org_, allows new students to explore and learn how to take an edX course. We recommend that you become familiar with the studentâ€™s experience of an edX course before you begin building your first course.

.. note:: You may want to include information about the edX Demo Course in your course materials, and recommend that new students take the edX Demo Course before proceeding with your course.
