This chapter describes how you develop course components. See:

* `What is a Component?`_
* `Add a Component`_
* `Edit a Component`_
* `Duplicate a Component`_
* `Delete a Component`_

For more information about specific component types, see:

* :ref:`Creating Course Content Index`
* :ref:`Exercises and Tools Index`

********************
What is a Component?
********************

A component is the part of a unit that contains your actual course content. A
unit can contain one or more components.

A student can view the name of all components in a unit by hovering over the
unit in the ribbon at the top of the page.

By default, Studio includes four types of components.

* **Discussion components** provide discussion spaces in the body of your
  course. Students can explore ideas about a lesson with their peers in a
  discussion space.
* **HTML components** allow you to add text, images, and some types of learning
  tools to your course. Content in HTML components is formatted as HTML.
* **Problem components** enable you to add many different types of exercises
  and problems to you course, from simple multiple choice problems to complex
  circuit schematic exercises.
* **Video components** contain the videos that you want to include in your
  course.

.. _Add a Component:

********************
Add a Component
********************

To add a component to the unit, click the component type that you want under
**Add New Component**.

For more information, see the documentation for the specific component type
that you want:

- :ref:`Working with Discussion Components`
- :ref:`Working with HTML Components`
- :ref:`Working with Problem Components`
- :ref:`Working with Video Components`
  
After you add a component, it is not visible to students until you
:ref:`publish the unit<Publish a Unit>`.

.. _Edit a Component:

********************
Edit a Component
********************

To edit a component, click **Edit**:

Then follow instructions for the type of component you are editing.

After you edit a component, the changes are not visible to students until you
:ref:`publish the unit<Publish a Unit>`.

=====================================
Set the Display Name for a Component
=====================================

Each component has a display name that shows in the component header when you
can edit the component. The display name also shows to students when they hover
the cursor over the unit icon in the course ribbon.

To set the display name for a component:

#. Edit the component.
#. Click **Settings**.
#. Edit the **Display Name** field.

4. Click **Save**.

Different types of components have different fields in the Settings dialog box,
but all have the **Display Name** field.

.. _Duplicate a Component:

**********************
Duplicate a Component
**********************

When you duplicate a component, a new copy of that component is added directly
beneath the first component. You can then modify the duplicate. In many cases,
duplicating a component and editing a copy is a faster way to create new
content.

To duplicate a component, click the Duplicate icon in the component header:

.. image:: ../Images/unit-dup.png
  :alt: Image of a unit with Duplicate icon circled

Then follow instructions for the type of component you are editing.

After you duplicate a component, the new component is not visible to students
until you :ref:`publish the unit<Publish a Unit>`.

.. _Delete a Component:

**********************
Delete a Component
**********************

.. note:: 
 Be sure you want to delete the component. You can not undo the deletion.

To delete a component:

#. Click the Delete icon in the component header:

.. image:: ../Images/unit-delete.png
  :alt: Image of a unit with Delete icon circled

2. When you receive the confirmation prompt, click **Yes, delete this
   component**.

After you delete a component, the component remians visible to students until you :ref:`publish the unit<Publish a Unit>`.
