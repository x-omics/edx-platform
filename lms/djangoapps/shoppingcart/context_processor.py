This is the shoppingcart context_processor module.
Currently the only context_processor detects whether request.user has a cart that should be displayed in the
navigation.  We want to do this in the context_processor to
1) keep database accesses out of templates (this led to a transaction bug with user email changes)
2) because navigation.html is "called" by being included in other templates, there's no "views.py" to put this.
