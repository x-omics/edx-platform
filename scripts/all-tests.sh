#
#   edx-all-tests.sh
#
#   Execute all tests for edx-platform.
#
#   This script can be called from a Jenkins
#   multiconfiguration job that defines these environment
#   variables:
#
#   `TEST_SUITE` defines which kind of test to run.
#   Possible values are:
#
#       - "quality": Run the quality (pep8/pylint) checks
#       - "unit": Run the JavaScript and Python unit tests
#            (also tests building the Sphinx documentation,
#             because we couldn't think of a better place to put it)
#       - "lms-acceptance": Run the acceptance (Selenium) tests for the LMS
#       - "cms-acceptance": Run the acceptance (Selenium) tests for Studio
#       - "bok-choy": Run acceptance tests that use the bok-choy framework
#
#   `SHARD` is a number (1, 2, or 3) indicating which subset of the tests
#       to build.  Currently, "lms-acceptance" and "bok-choy" each have two
#       shards (1 and 2), "cms-acceptance" has three shards (1, 2, and 3),
#       and all the other test suites have one shard.
#
#       For the "bok-choy", the tests are put into shard groups using the nose
#       'attr' decorator (e.g. "@attr('shard_1')").  Currently, anything with
#       the 'shard_1' attribute will run in the first shard.  All other bok-choy
#       tests will run in shard 2.
#
#       For the lettuce acceptance tests, ("lms-" and "cms-acceptance") they
#       are decorated with "@shard_{}" (e.g. @shard_1 for the first shard).
#       The lettuce tests must have a shard specified to be run in jenkins,
#       as there is no shard that runs unspecified tests.
#
#
#   Jenkins configuration:
#
#   - The edx-platform git repository is checked out by the Jenkins git plugin.
#
#   - Jenkins logs in as user "jenkins"
#
#   - The Jenkins file system root is "/home/jenkins"
#
#   - An init script creates a virtualenv at "/home/jenkins/edx-venv"
#     with some requirements pre-installed (such as scipy)
#
#  Jenkins worker setup:
#  See the edx/configuration repo for Jenkins worker provisioning scripts.
#  The provisioning scripts install requirements that this script depends on!
